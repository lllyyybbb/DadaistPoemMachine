# DadaistPoemMachine
A little code to make a Dadaist Poem Machine per Tristan Tzara's instructions.

You can find his instructions all over the place on the internet, but here's one place: https://www.writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/88v/tzara.html

Did this for fun! Fork, update, etc, whatever!

Python 3.
